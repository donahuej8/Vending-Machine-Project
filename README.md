# Vending-Machine-Project
This simple vending machine project utilizes basic object orientation in C++

The Driver will prompt the user to select whether or not he/she would like to create a default machine.
A default machine contains 5 basic product types for the machine (the user can start testing quicker).
After the machine is set up, the user will repeatedly be prompted to select an action to take.
Each action is labelled with a number next to it. Type in the corresponding number and hit "ENTER"
in order to select the option.

Program runs until user decides to end the program by selecting "(9) End program."

**This is my first attempt at a basic project in C++, so there may be bugs and there are definitely more 
efficient ways to go about doing things.**
